## Ananlogy 
Let’s start with an analogy first.  Say we like to study a group of fish, which live inside a tank, by recording their position relative to one another. However there is one problem, we are restricted to use a projector and its projection to collect data.  Luckily we still can place the projector any angle we like. Dimension wise, this condition restrict ourselves using 2 dimensional data to study 3 dimension world, despite each of the two dimension is still made out of the original three dimensions.  Under such a restriction, the projector’s position is big a deal, because a bad position is not able to reveal the relative position among the fish.
